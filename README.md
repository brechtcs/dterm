**DEPRECATED:** The next version of [Beaker Browser](https://beakerbrowser.com) will ship with a builtin terminal, which will give a much better experience than any userland implementation. 

Distributed terminal, forked from [Webterm](https://github.com/pfrazee/webterm).

## Why?

You do your best work offline. Your team needs online. Ever wondered how to solve this dilemma? The solution is to use tools that work offline but also support [asychronous communication](https://m.signalvnoise.com/is-group-chat-making-you-sweat/) and synchronisation when online. With the [dat protocol](https://datprotocol.org) and [Beaker Browser](https://beakerbrowser.com) it has become easier than ever to build reliable tools to do just that.

This project provides a basic terminal interface to browse and manipulate dat archives. [Try it](https://dterm.hashbase.io) yourself in Beaker.

## How?

Read [the docs](https://dterm.hashbase.io/docs) to get started.

## Terms

AGPL-v3.0 (previously [MIT](https://github.com/dterm/dterm/releases/tag/MIT))
